# Football 2D with P5.js library

I have made this project because I wanted to implement a simple physics engine in
a little game on HTML5 canvas. I was inspired by _The coding train_ Youtube channel
and [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MQ-FugwbI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM).
